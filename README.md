# SEMLI - A simple social app

Semli is a simple social app built for educational purposes. I decided to build it right after finishing a TypeScript course at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript) to solidify my existing knowledge and learn some additional ones.

## Technologies used

For this project I used the following technologies:

- HTML & CSS
- React JS
- TypeScript
- Styled components
- Firebase (the NoSQL database Firestore, Storage and Auth)
- React Router
- Git using GitHub
- SVGR
- NPM

I decided not to build this project using Redux to get more practice using existing hooks and custom ones.

## Live version

If you want to take a look at the project, simply visit [semli-38800.firebaseapp.com](https://semli-38800.firebaseapp.com/).

## Comment

There are multiple parts of the applications that can be improved and functions to be added. However, since this was for educational purposes, I decided to not dive too deep into this.

The rules used for Firebase are available in the files firestore.rules and storage.rules.
